# Stock Price Prediction
Predict Stock Prices Using RNN Deep Learning Models

This is my improved model where I use 21 different Technical Indicators to train the RNN Model using LSTM.

#### When I trained the model with just Closing Price and Volume - below was the result

While the accuracy with the 21 Indicators is much better, I believe Hyperparameter Tuning and Better Feature Selection will help in getting much better results
